/**
 * ------Integer Types in Rust--------

    Length	Signed	Unsigned
     8-bit	  i8    	 u8
     16-bit	  i16   	 u16
     32-bit  	i32   	 u32
     64-bit  	i64   	 u64
     128-bit 	i128  	 u128
     arch	    isize	   usize

     Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2n - 1) to 2n - 1 - 1 inclusive, where n is the number of bits that variant uses. So an i8 can store numbers from -(27) to 27 - 1, which equals -128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2n - 1, so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 28 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.

     Additionally, the isize and usize types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as “arch”: 64 bits if you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a 32-bit architecture.
